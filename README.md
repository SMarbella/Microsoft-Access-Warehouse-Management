# Microsoft-Access-Projects
I included one comprehensive capstone project and one final project in this repository.
These are Microsoft Capstone Projects from LIS 470. They demonstrate my use of Microsoft Access to keep track of warehouse inventories.

I designed the forms and the interface to make them look attractive.

We need forms to make an interactive interface for our
database and organize the columns in a visually stunning
way. Without forms, our database could look plain and
feel like something is missing, so we need something that
can improve the user interface of our database. In our
forms, we added navigation and print buttons. The user
can use these buttons to navigate between pages and print
the customers form, employees form, and products form.

In this database, I created the forms and the navigation
form for our company. I also designed a simple background
and chose the theme for the forms. When I was thinking of
a background, I was thinking of the color blue because it
is more soothing to the eyes of the audience. It can also
represent the emotions that the audience feel when they
either receive their packages or did not receive their
packages.

While I was designing the background, I was thinking of
something calm and playful, which explain the rising and
desolving bubbles in the background. At the bottom of the
background, they can represent items at a warehouse that
have not been sold. The top of the background can represent
items being shipped and the stocks decreasing.

I imagined tranquility, peacefulness, and the emotion of
being calm because customers are required to wait patiently
for their purchased items to arrive. The arrival of their
orders represents a rewarding moment when they finally
receive their orders or a sad moment when their orders
fail to arrive.

The information included in the forms are designed by how
I felt where the information goes. It is also styled after
identification cards and book pages. Anything that is an ID
acts like a page number. The Employees Form has influences
from ID cards and passports seen in video games where the
picture of the person goes on the left side of the document
with the identifying information on the right side.

Next, we will see the interfaces of each form.

Here is the:
Customers Form
Employees Form
Navigation Form
Orders Form
Products Form
and Warehouses Form.

The next person coming up is Ryan. He will be speaking about
the reports.
